we need to preprocess the game date before we use reinforcement learning, 
there are mainly 2 preprocesing steps:-
1) Greyscaling 
2) framestacking (screen shot taken)
as the color image has three times the many pixels to process and converting them into greyscale cuts down the data it needs to learn from 
framestacking helps our AI have context by stacking consecutive frames we are giving our AI model memory, it will be able to see mario and 
its enemy's movements

before preprocessing :-
Libraries to install :-
	pip install torch==1.10.1+cu113 torchvision==0.11.2+cu113 torchaudio===0.10.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html

error while executing greyscale:-
**kwargs)
    377 def reset(self, **kwargs):
    378     &quot;&quot;&quot;Resets the environment, returning a modified observation using :meth:`self.observation`.&quot;&quot;&quot;
--&gt; 379     obs, info = self.env.reset(**kwargs)
    380     return self.observation(obs), info
    ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2),

Solution:- 
change core.py file lines with :- 
 def reset(self, **kwargs):
        """Resets the environment, returning a modified observation using :meth:`self.observation`."""
        obs= self.env.reset(**kwargs)
        return self.observation(obs)
